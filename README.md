# js-metacrafters

Compilation of projects.

## Description

This repository houses a collection of projects from my metacrafters courses. It includes two main files:

- `mytoken.sol` is a Solidity smart contract that serves as a foundational example of token creation. It showcases basic functions and syntax for creating a token, managing balances, and implementing minting and burning mechanisms.

- `nft_metacraft.js` is a JavaScript file that provides hands-on experience in the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This file demonstrates the fundamentals of JavaScript, including the creation of NFT objects with metadata, listing NFTs, and tracking the total supply of NFTs. It also includes a function to identify legendary NFTs based on their supply. 

These projects are valuable for understanding the essential functions and syntax of Solidity and JavaScript, making them ideal for educational purposes and practical learning.
